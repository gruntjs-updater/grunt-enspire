> A plugin for specific use with in Enspire Commerce.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-enspire --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-enspire');
```

## The "enspire" task

### Overview
The enspire plugin is designed for use within Enspire Commerce projects. It allows a project to pull in shared themes, modules and views from the main enspire.platform repo. It is also our answer to making general updates and additions to the main Gruntfile with having to manual update every repo.

To run, just type the following in your shell.

```shell
grunt enspire
```
